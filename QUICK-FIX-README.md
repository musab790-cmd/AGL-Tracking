## 🧪 Test the Fix

### Simple 2-Device Test:

1. **Open app on Phone:**
   - Check top-right: Should show green "Synced"

2. **Open app on Laptop:**
   - Check top-right: Should show green "Synced"

3. **Add a task on Phone:**
   - Click "Add PPM Task"
   - Fill in any details
   - Click "Add Task"

4. **Watch Laptop (wait 1-2 seconds):**
   - ✅ The new task should appear automatically!

## 🔍 Verify It's Working

**Open Browser Console (F12) and look for:**

✅ Firebase connected
💾 Data saved to Firebase successfully
📥 PPM tasks synced from Firebase: X
✅ Sync flag cleared
```

## ⚠️ Still Not Working?

### Check These:

1. **Internet Connection:**
   - Both devices need active internet
   - Test by opening any website

2. **Firebase Rules:**
   - Go to Firebase Console → Database → Rules
   - Should be:
   ```json
   {
     "rules": {
       ".read": true,
       ".write": true
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Clear Cache:**
   - Browser cache can cause old code to run
   - Must clear on ALL devices

4. **Check Console for Errors:**
   - Press F12 in browser
   - Look for red error messages
   - Send screenshots if you see errors

---

## 📝 What Changed in the Code

**Technical Details (for reference):**
- Added `isSyncing` flag to prevent listener loops
- Changed `saveData()` to async function with `Promise.all()`
- Added sync flag checks in Firebase listeners
- Added 1-second delay to allow Firebase propagation

**Result:** Clean, reliable real-time sync! 🎉
