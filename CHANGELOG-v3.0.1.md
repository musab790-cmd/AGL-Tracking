# AGL MCT Airfield Maintenance Tracker - v3.0.1 CHANGELOG

## Version 3.0.1 - FIREBASE SYNC FIX (Critical Update)
**Release Date:** Current
**Type:** Bug Fix (Critical)

---

### üêõ CRITICAL BUG FIX

#### Issue: Cross-Device Sync Not Working
**Problem:** 
- App showed "Synced" status but changes made on one device were not appearing on other devices
- Tasks added on phone wouldn't sync to laptop and vice versa
- Firebase connection was established but data propagation was failing

**Root Cause:**
The Firebase real-time listeners were creating a circular update loop:
1. Device A saves data ‚Üí Firebase updates
2. Firebase listener on Device A detects change ‚Üí overwrites local array
3. This prevented proper propagation to Device B

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Added Sync Flag (`isSyncing`)**: Prevents listener loops during active saves
2. **Async Save Operations**: Uses `Promise.all()` to ensure both PPM and CM tasks are saved atomically
3. **Smart Listener Management**: Listeners skip processing when a sync is in progress on the same device
4. **Sync Delay**: 1-second delay after save to allow Firebase to propagate changes before re-enabling listeners

---

### üìù Technical Changes

#### Modified Functions:
1. **`saveData()`**
   - Changed to `async function`
   - Added `isSyncing` flag management
   - Implemented `Promise.all()` for atomic writes
   - Enhanced logging for debugging
   - Added 1-second sync cooldown

2. **Firebase Listeners**
   - PPM tasks listener: Added sync flag check
   - CM tasks listener: Added sync flag check
   - Both skip processing during active sync operations

3. **Global Variables**
   - Added: `let isSyncing = false;`

---

### ‚úÖ Expected Behavior After Fix

**Before v3.0.1:**
- ‚ùå Phone adds task ‚Üí Laptop shows nothing
- ‚ùå Changes don't propagate between devices
- ‚úì Connection status shows "Synced" (misleading)

**After v3.0.1:**
- ‚úÖ Phone adds task ‚Üí Laptop updates in ~1-2 seconds
- ‚úÖ All changes sync across all devices in real-time
- ‚úÖ Connection status accurately reflects sync state
- ‚úÖ No duplicate tasks or data conflicts

---

### üîç Testing Instructions

1. **Two-Device Test:**
   - Open app on Device A (e.g., phone)
   - Open app on Device B (e.g., laptop)
   - Verify both show "Synced" status
   
2. **Add Task Test:**
   - Add a PPM task on Device A
   - Within 1-2 seconds, verify task appears on Device B
   - Check dashboard counts update on both devices
   
3. **Edit Task Test:**
   - Edit an existing task on Device B
   - Verify changes appear on Device A
   
4. **Delete Task Test:**
   - Delete a task on Device A
   - Verify deletion syncs to Device B

5. **Console Verification:**
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Watch for log messages:
     - `üíæ Data saved to Firebase successfully`
     - `üì• PPM tasks synced from Firebase: X`
     - `‚úÖ Sync flag cleared`

---

### üö® Important Notes

- **Internet Required:** Real-time sync requires active internet connection
- **Sync Delay:** Changes may take 1-2 seconds to appear on other devices (this is normal)
- **Offline Mode:** If a device goes offline, changes are saved locally and will sync when reconnection occurs
- **Console Logs:** Check browser console for detailed sync activity

---

### üì¶ Files Changed
- `app.js` - Core sync logic fixes

### üîÑ Migration from v3.0
- **No action required** - Simply replace the old `app.js` file
- Existing Firebase configuration remains unchanged
- All data is preserved

---

### üéØ Next Steps for Users

1. **Replace Files:**
   - Download v3.0.1 package
   - Replace `app.js` in your deployment
   
2. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
   - Clear cached files
   - Reload the app
   
3. **Test Sync:**
   - Open app on multiple devices
   - Verify real-time synchronization is working

4. **Report Issues:**
   - If sync still doesn't work, check browser console for error messages
   - Verify Firebase Rules allow read/write access

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

**If sync still doesn't work:**

1. **Check Firebase Rules:**
   ```json
   {
     "rules": {
       ".read": true,
       ".write": true
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Verify firebase-config.js:**
   - Ensure all credentials are correct
   - Check for typos in API keys

3. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Look for Firebase errors
   - Verify "‚úÖ Firebase connected" message appears

4. **Network Issues:**
   - Ensure stable internet connection
   - Check if corporate firewall blocks Firebase
