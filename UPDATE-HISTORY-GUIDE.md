   ```
   - Task was completed yesterday
   - No photos uploaded

3. **Only photos:**
   ```
   Latest photo uploaded 3 days ago
   ```
   - Task has photos but not completed yet
   - Or completed but no `lastCompleted` timestamp

4. **No updates:**
   ```
   No recent updates
   ```
   - Task hasn't been completed or had photos uploaded
   - May be a new task or one needing attention

## 📅 Understanding "Recently Completed" (Last 7 Days)

The summary shows tasks completed in the last 7 days:

```
✅ Recently Completed (Last 7 days): 5
```

This metric helps you:
- Track team productivity
- See if maintenance schedule is on track
- Identify which tasks were finished recently

The "RECENT UPDATES" section lists these tasks with their descriptions!

---

## 📷 Photo Evidence Tracking

### Why It Matters:
- Compliance requirements (proof of maintenance)
- Quality assurance (visual evidence of work)
- Historical record (before/after comparisons)
- Audit trails (documentation for inspections)

### What's Tracked:
```
Photos: 3 photo(s) attached
Latest photo uploaded 2 days ago
```

- **Count**: How many photos are attached
- **Timestamp**: When the most recent photo was added
- **Helps identify**: Tasks with/without proper documentation
