# 🔧 CM Tasks Dashboard Fix - v2.3.2 Final

## Issue Reported

**User:** *"added cm not showing in the project dashboard"*

**Problem:** After adding a CM task:
1. ✅ Task was saved to localStorage
2. ✅ Success notification appeared
3. ❌ Dashboard showed "0" for CM tasks
4. ❌ CM task was not visible (user stayed in PPM view)
5. ❌ User had to manually click "🔧 CM Tasks" to see the task

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### **1. Auto-Switch to CM View After Adding**

**Before:**
```
User clicks "Add CM" → Fills form → Saves
Result: Modal closes, stays in PPM view
User sees: PPM table (no CM tasks visible)
Action needed: Manually click "🔧 CM Tasks" button
```

**After:**
```
User clicks "Add CM" → Fills form → Saves
Result: Automatically switches to CM view
User sees: CM table with newly added task
Action needed: None! Task is immediately visible
```

**Code Change:**
```javascript
function addCMTask(event) {
    // ... save logic ...
    
    saveData();
    updateDashboard();
    
    // ✅ NEW: Auto-switch to CM view to show the task
    switchView('cm');
    
    closeAddCMModal();
}
```

---

### **2. Enhanced Dashboard CM Count**

**Before:**
- Dashboard card showed: "OPEN CM TASKS"
- Only counted tasks with status = "Open"
- Missed "In Progress" and "Pending Parts" tasks

**After:**
- Dashboard card shows: "ACTIVE CM TASKS"
- Counts all unresolved tasks:
  - ✅ Open
  - ✅ In Progress
  - ✅ Pending Parts
  - ❌ Resolved (not counted - already done)

**Code Change:**
```javascript
// Before:
const openCMCount = cmTasks.filter(task => 
    task.status === 'Open'
).length;

// After:
const openCMCount = cmTasks.filter(task => 
    task.status === 'Open' || 
    task.status === 'In Progress' || 
    task.status === 'Pending Parts'
).length;
```

---

### **3. Added Debug Logging**

Added console logging to help diagnose dashboard issues:

```javascript
console.log('Dashboard updated:', {
    dueTodayCount,
    overdueCount,
    inProgressCount,
    openCMCount,
    totalCMTasks: cmTasks.length
});
```

**How to use:**
1. Open browser console (F12 → Console tab)
2. Add a CM task
3. Check console output to verify counts

---

### **4. Fixed Filter Display on Load**

**Before:**
- Shift filter sometimes not visible on page load
- CM status filter sometimes showing when it shouldn't

**After:**
- Shift filter visible by default (PPM is default view)
- CM status filter hidden until switching to CM view
- Event listeners properly attached

---

## 📊 Dashboard Card Updates

### **Card Title Changed:**
```
OLD: "OPEN CM TASKS" 
NEW: "ACTIVE CM TASKS"
```

### **Icon Changed:**
```
OLD: ⚙️ (gear icon)
NEW: 🔧 (wrench icon - more fitting for repairs)
```

### **Count Logic:**
```
Active CM Tasks = Open + In Progress + Pending Parts
(Does NOT include Resolved tasks)
```

---

## 🎬 User Experience Flow

6. **Still in PPM view** ❌
7. User confused - where's my task?

**Result:** Confusing, required extra clicks

---

### **After Fix:**

1. User clicks "Add CM"
2. Fills form: WO-001, High priority, etc.

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### **Test 1: Add CM Task and Verify Dashboard**

1. **Before adding:** Note dashboard "ACTIVE CM TASKS" count
2. Click **"Add CM"** button
3. Fill in form:
   - Work Order: TEST-001
   - Description: Test task
   - Priority: High
   - Location: Test area
   - Reported By: Your name
   - Date: Today
   - Status: **Open** (important!)
   - Assigned To: Test user
4. Click **"Save Task"**

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Success notification appears
- ✅ Modal closes
- ✅ **View automatically switches to CM Tasks**
- ✅ **CM table appears**
- ✅ **Your new task is visible in the table**
- ✅ **Dashboard "ACTIVE CM TASKS" increases by 1**

---

### **Test 2: Verify Dashboard Counts Different Statuses**

1. Add CM task with Status = **"Open"**
2. Check dashboard → **Count increases** ✅
3. Edit task, change Status to **"In Progress"**
4. Check dashboard → **Count stays the same** ✅
5. Edit task, change Status to **"Pending Parts"**
6. Check dashboard → **Count stays the same** ✅
7. Edit task, change Status to **"Resolved"**
8. Check dashboard → **Count decreases by 1** ✅

**Why:** Dashboard shows "ACTIVE" tasks (Open + In Progress + Pending), not "Resolved"

---

### **Test 3: Multiple CM Tasks**

1. Add 3 CM tasks:
   - Task 1: Status = Open
   - Task 2: Status = In Progress
   - Task 3: Status = Pending Parts
2. Check dashboard
3. **Expected:** Shows "3 ACTIVE CM TASKS"
4. Mark Task 1 as "Resolved"
5. **Expected:** Shows "2 ACTIVE CM TASKS"

---

### **Test 4: Console Logging**

1. Open browser console (F12 → Console tab)
2. Add a CM task
3. **Expected:** See console output like:
   ```
   Dashboard updated: {
       dueTodayCount: 5,
       overdueCount: 2,
       inProgressCount: 3,
       openCMCount: 4,
       totalCMTasks: 6
   }
   ```
4. Verify `openCMCount` matches dashboard display
5. Verify `totalCMTasks` includes all CM tasks (even Resolved)

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Issue:** Dashboard still shows "0" after adding CM task

**Check:**
1. Open console (F12)
2. Look for error messages
3. Check dashboard update log
4. Verify `cmTasks` array has items:
   ```javascript
   // In console, type:
   cmTasks
   // Should show array with your tasks
   ```

**Solutions:**
- Refresh page (Ctrl+F5)
- Clear localStorage and try again
- Check browser console for errors

---

### **Issue:** CM task added but not visible in table

**Check:**
1. Are you in CM view? Look for **blue "🔧 CM Tasks"** button
2. If not, click it manually
3. Check if auto-switch failed (browser console for errors)

**Solution:**
- This fix should prevent this issue
- If still happening, manually click "🔧 CM Tasks"

---

### **Issue:** Dashboard count doesn't match visible tasks

**Possible causes:**
1. Some tasks have status "Resolved" (not counted in dashboard)
2. Filter is active (table shows filtered, dashboard shows all)

**Check:**
1. Dashboard shows: Open + In Progress + Pending Parts
2. Table may show: Filtered subset based on status filter
3. Click "All Status" in filter to see all CM tasks

---
