## 📝 Technical Implementation

### Modified File: `app.js`

**Changes to `generatePDFDocument()` function:**

#### 1. Enhanced Summary Section (Lines ~704-754)
```javascript
// Added photo count
const tasksWithPhotos = tasks.filter(t => t.photos && t.photos.length > 0).length;
doc.text(`📷 Tasks with Photos: ${tasksWithPhotos}`, 14, yPos);

// Added recently completed count (last 7 days)
const recentlyCompleted = tasks.filter(t => {
    if (!t.lastCompleted) return false;
    const daysSince = Math.floor((new Date() - new Date(t.lastCompleted)) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
    return daysSince <= 7;
}).length;
doc.text(`✅ Recently Completed (Last 7 days): ${recentlyCompleted}`, 14, yPos);

// Recent Updates Timeline
if (recentlyCompleted > 0) {
    const recentTasks = tasks
        .filter(t => t.lastCompleted)
        .sort((a, b) => new Date(b.lastCompleted) - new Date(a.lastCompleted))
        .slice(0, 5);
    
    for (const task of recentTasks) {
        const daysSince = Math.floor((new Date() - new Date(task.lastCompleted)) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
        const timeAgo = daysSince === 0 ? 'Today' : daysSince === 1 ? 'Yesterday' : `${daysSince} days ago`;
        doc.text(`• ${timeAgo}: ${task.description}`, 14, yPos);
    }
}
```

#### 2. Detailed Task Information (Lines ~760-860)
```javascript
// Boxed layout for each task
doc.rect(14, boxStartY, pageWidth - 28, boxHeight);

// Complete task information
doc.text('Description:', 16, yPos);
doc.text('Shift:', 16, yPos);
doc.text('Type:', 70, yPos);
doc.text('Frequency:', 110, yPos);
doc.text('Status:', 16, yPos); // With color coding
doc.text('Due Date:', 110, yPos);

doc.text(`Day: ${dayShift}`, 42, yPos);
doc.text(`Night: ${nightShift}`, 110, yPos);
doc.text('Photos:', 16, yPos);
doc.text(`${photoCount} photo(s) attached`, 42, yPos);

// Last completed tracking
if (task.lastCompleted) {
    doc.text('Last Completed:', 110, yPos);
    doc.text(new Date(task.lastCompleted).toLocaleDateString(), 145, yPos);
}
```

#### 3. Update Timeline Per Task (Lines ~862-890)
```javascript
// Calculate time since last update
if (task.lastCompleted) {
    const daysSince = Math.floor((new Date() - new Date(task.lastCompleted)) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
    const timeAgo = daysSince === 0 ? 'today' : daysSince === 1 ? 'yesterday' : `${daysSince} days ago`;
    updateInfo += `Last update: Completed ${timeAgo}`;
}

// Track photo uploads
if (photoCount > 0) {
    const latestPhoto = task.photos[task.photos.length - 1];
    if (latestPhoto && latestPhoto.timestamp) {
        const photoDays = Math.floor((new Date() - new Date(latestPhoto.timestamp)) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
        const photoTimeAgo = photoDays === 0 ? 'today' : photoDays === 1 ? 'yesterday' : `${photoDays} days ago`;
        updateInfo += `Latest photo uploaded ${photoTimeAgo}`;
    }
}

doc.text(updateInfo, 16, yPos);
