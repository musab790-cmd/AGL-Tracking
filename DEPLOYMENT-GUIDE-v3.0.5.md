# Deployment Guide - v3.0.5 PDF Photo Thumbnails

## 🎯 Overview
Version 3.0.5 adds visual photo thumbnails to PDF reports for both PPM and CM tasks. This is a **minor update** that only changes the `app.js` file.

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Current version is v3.0.4 (CM Photos)
- [ ] Firebase sync is working properly
- [ ] You have recent backups (data is in Firebase)
- [ ] You have tested the new version locally (optional but recommended)

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Option A: Quick Update (Recommended)
**Only app.js has changed** - Replace just this file:

1. **Backup Current File** (just in case)
   - Download your current `app.js` to a safe location
   - Name it something like `app-v3.0.4-backup.js`

2. **Replace app.js**
   - Extract `app.js` from the v3.0.5 ZIP package
   - Upload to your hosting location (Teams, SharePoint, etc.)
   - Replace the old `app.js` file

3. **Test Immediately**
   - Open the app in browser
   - Check Firebase sync still works (green indicator)
   - Generate a PDF report with tasks that have photos
   - Verify photos appear as thumbnails in the PDF

4. **Clear Browser Cache** (if needed)
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
   - This forces browser to load the new app.js file

### Option B: Full Package Deployment
Replace all files for a clean install:

1. **Download Current Data** (optional safety measure)
   - Click "Export to CSV" in your current app
   - Save the CSV file as backup

2. **Replace All Files**
   - Extract entire v3.0.5 ZIP package
   - Upload all files to your hosting location
   - Replace existing files

3. **Verify Firebase Config**
   - Check `firebase-config.js` still has your credentials
   - If replaced, update with your Firebase project details

4. **Test Full Functionality**
   - Open app and verify Firebase connection
   - Check both PPM and CM tasks display
   - Test photo uploads (both types)
   - Generate PDF report with photos

## 🔍 Verification Tests

### Critical Tests (Must Pass)
1. **Firebase Sync**: Green "Connected" indicator appears
2. **PDF Generation**: Reports generate without errors
3. **Photo Thumbnails**: Photos appear in PDF (small, not full-size)
4. **Both Task Types**: PDF includes both PPM and CM sections

### Quick Test Scenario
```
1. Find or create a PPM task with 2 photos
2. Find or create a CM task with 3 photos
3. Generate report covering both tasks
4. Open PDF and verify:
   ✓ Both PPM and CM sections present
   ✓ Photo thumbnails visible (small squares)
   ✓ Task details readable
   ✓ No layout issues or overlapping
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: PDF Shows No Photos
**Symptoms**: PDF generates but no photo thumbnails appear
**Solution**: 
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Verify tasks actually have photos (view in app)
- Try regenerating PDF
- Clear browser cache and try again

### Issue: "Firebase Not Connected"
**Symptoms**: Red indicator, data not syncing
**Solution**:
- This shouldn't happen if only app.js changed
- Check `firebase-config.js` wasn't accidentally replaced
- Verify Firebase project is still active
- Check browser console for specific errors

### Issue: PDF Generation Error
**Symptoms**: Error message when clicking "Generate PDF Report"
**Solution**:
- Check if jsPDF library is loading (network tab in dev tools)
- Verify date range is valid
- Try with smaller date range (fewer tasks)
- Check for corrupted photo data

### Issue: Photos Too Large/Small
**Symptoms**: Photos don't look right in PDF
**Solution**:
- Current setting is 25px x 25px (medium size)
- This is hardcoded in `app.js` lines 1373 and 1493
- To adjust, change `const photoSize = 25;` to desired size
- Recommended range: 20-40px

## 📊 What Changed

### Modified Files
- **app.js** - Complete rewrite of PDF generation functions

### Unchanged Files (from v3.0.4)
- **index.html** - User interface
- **styles.css** - Styling
